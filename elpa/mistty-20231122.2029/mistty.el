  "Make `completion-at-point' functions work nice with autosuggestions.

Shell autosuggestions and `completion-at-point' don't work well
together: as the typical `completion-at-point' function looks
around the point for the object to complete, it'll see the
shell's autosuggestions and think that this is what the user
typed. So if the used typed \"com\" and the shell autosuggestion
is \"complete\", what's shown on the buffer \"com<point>plete\"
and naturally `completion-at-point' auto-completes \"complete\"
not \"com\".

To work around that, MisTTY wraps functions on
`completion-at-point-functions' so that they don't see what's
after the point, while on the terminal region. In the example
above, these wrapped functions only see \"com\" and complete
that.

This does mean that completion doesn't work exactly the same way
as it normally does: it only see what's before the point - but
the resulting behavior is saner.

This option turns on a hack that attempts to make auto-completion

Packages that offer auto-completion often insert a function into
`post-command-hook' and run a function a while after a string of
`self-insert-command' has run.

This doesn't work in MisTTY terminal region, as keystrokes are
sent directly to the terminal and `self-insert-command' is just
not used.

MisTTY offers the hook `mistty-interactive-insert-hook' that
allows implementing auto-completion in the terminal region.

This option turns on the simulation of `self-insert-command' and
their pre and post hooks being called whenever that hook is
called. This is implemented by the function

MisTTY's replaying of modifications is turned off while a
long-running command is active, so the command can run without
interference. The result of the command is sent to the shell once
it's inactive.

MisTTY detects some long-running commands on its own by tracking
overlay, when `mistty-detect-foreign-overlays' is turned on. It
also detects completion in region by tracking
`completion-in-region-mode'.

Call this function when you'd like to use long-running command
that's not detected by MisTTY.

ID is a symbol that identifies the long-running command, so that
you can track and report several such commands without worrying
about interference. The same naming convention as you would for
functions to keep them unique.

If ACTIVE evaluates to true, report the long-running command as
active, which inhibits MisTTY's normal operation for the duration
of the command. If ACTIVE is nil, report the long-running command
as inactive, which turns MisTTY on again and triggers replaying
of any changes made in the terminal zone during that
command (unless a command with another ID is active; check with
`mistty-long-running-command-p')."
