Call a comment command according to the context.

If the region is active, toggle commenting according to the value
of `comment-dwim-2-region-function'.
Else, the function applies to the current line and calls a
different function at each successive call.  The algorithm is:
* First  call : Toggle line commenting
* Second call : - Kill end-of-line comment if present (1)
                - Insert end-of-line comment otherwise
Given an prefix ARG, it reindents the inline comment instead (2).

You can also switch behaviors of (1) and (2) by setting
`comment-dwim-2-inline-comment-behavior' to \\='reindent-comment.
